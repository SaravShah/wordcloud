It's been two weeks and I keep forgetting to put the ex there. This is an incredible amount of work for a shitpost and I love you for it \n\n*upvote***Context**: They had been talking about DeAndre Liggins and his shying away from taking shots. LeBron said it wasn't his job to shoot, that his job was to defend. He added that they trusted him to take and make big shots though.\n\n\nLater the reporter referenced the conversation saying \I know you said he's not supposed to shoot...\.\n\nEdit: [Here's the relevant part of the interview that the reporter was \paraphrasing\](https://streamable.com/b4je7)\n\nIf you're going to talk shit, back it up on the court. If you're going to talk shit to the opponent's kids, don't fucking play.This is what rivalry should be Lmao \lebron james fires blatt.\Dammit James\n\nFor anyone doubting it's him, just remember he was the Shaqtin MVP last year Oh shit they're playing again lmaoI don't understand why people have so much trouble saying his name. There are plenty of foreign names I fuck up because the sounds are uncommon in english, but Antetokounmpo contains common english sounds. I'm sure I don't say it with the perfect native intonations, but it's easy to get very close. First player to hang up his jersey by himselfMost underrated dude in the league i thought these would be a lot more vicious tbhSome observations:\n\n-Brook Lopez is the only above-average NBA player on the Nets according to RPM\n\n-Isaiah Thomas gives back a good chunk of his value as one of the biggest defensive liabilities in the league\n\n-LeBron James is not human.\n\n-Channing Frye making a push for it to become the Big 4!\n\n-Harrison Barnes continues his lifelong streak of being between -1.0 to 1.0 RPM\n\n-Harrison Barnes has never been ahead of a Curry on his team.\n\n-Jokic continues to be an advanced analytics darling.  Mudiay dead-last on his team :/\n\n-Reggie Jackson is struggling since his return from injury\n\n-Draymond Green is a defensive monster, and his impact is still felt more in RPM than Durant, despite his career year.\n\n-Zaza Pachulia seems to have filled Bogut's role to near perfection.\n\n-Klay Thompson, as many have pointed out via the eye test this season, does indeed appear to have regressed defensively\n\n-Houston's defense appears surprisingly decent!  Their ORPM numbers are pure fire, yet they don't seem to be sacrificing much on D.  MOREYBALL!!!\n\n-Paul George is 4th on his own team... I don't watch the Pacers, what is that about?\n\n-Chris Paul is on fucking fire.  Point God, indeed.\n\n-Lou Williams and Swaggy P are the best players on the Lakers.  I'll let that sink in...\n\n-No one tell Vince Carter how old he is\n\n-Depressing to look at the Heat roster after making four straight finals 2011-2014... how the mighty have fallen\n\n-Antetokounmpo has made the leap!  Happy for Bucks fans.\n\n-Anthony Davis's supporting cast is fucking atrocious.  Why did they let Anderson and Gordon go?  This Front Office seems terrible, they deserve to get LeBron'd and he should leave at the end of his contract.\n\n-As many have said, this is Porzingod's team now.\n\n-Joakim Noah is a plus!  I've been throwing shade at his \terrible\ contract all year, and he is making me (and many others) look pretty stupid!  \n\n-Westbrook is on pace for the Oscar Robertson triple double season.  Insane ORPM!\n\n-Oregon has no state tax, and apparently no backcourt defense, either.\n\n-Kawhi Leonard continues to develop into an offensive powerhouse with 5.1 ORPM, but seems to have regressed on defense, with only 1.1 DRPM.\n\n-Ty Lawson has bounced back into an NBA average player!  \n\n-NBA fans continue to ignore DeMar DeRozan's horrible defense and overrating him\n\n-Toronto's team is insanely deep and balanced\n\n-Rudy Gobert leads the league with 4.8 DRPM. Utah is looking really nice!Didn't look like a big boy when he was hiding his face in his shirt and couldn't even bear to watch his teamates playing defense.\n\nAlso didn't look like a big boy in the post game when he was fighting back tears while talking to reporters.I missed the hypothetical tag and got so hyped. Kobe has done the same thing. \n\n\nShoot your shot. B. You'll get em next time. &gt; Because I don't want anybody to know my identity. I'm like a superhero. Call me Basketball Man.   \n   \nThis is goldThat's gold lol. \n\nUnrelated to the tweet but sucks for Giannis because so many people will misspell his last name accidentallyklay's asshole winked after that dunkI don't know much about Mejri outside of the Pop trash talk. But I know that Ariza and especially Beverly are no angels themselves. Wonder if we'll ever know the true story.[Streamable mirror](https://streamable.com/aopyz)\n\nvia /u/TwittertoStreamabledude is going out in a flame of dumpster fire proportions&gt; Gastroenteritis, also known as infectious diarrhea, is inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract that involves the stomach and small intestine.He knows Deron's crossover has been shit since 2012Curry has the coolest dad everNo idea but I feel like players have put these stats up in less than 30 minutes but ended up playing more than 30 (as starters tend to do). Still impressive.
